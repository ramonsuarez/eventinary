# No More No Shows
## Ticketing for free events, get paid by those that don't attend
### Pain
Free / community event organizers have to deal with a great number of no shows (people that sign up but don't attend). This raises the costs of organizing the event and diminish their perceived value: a big venue seems half empty, you have to pay for the rental of the venue and other expenses (like food and staff), which also hurts the organizer's morale.
